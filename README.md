# Indian Rainfall Prediction

This Project has been done under the mentorship of Linux World Informatics Private Limited.


## Gist About the Project:

In India, Rainfall or Monsoon is one of the great important factors of nature. Generally two types of predictions can be done for analyzing.
-	Type 1- Long Term Predictions
-	Type 2- Short Term Predictions

In this project, it is tried to analyze the Long Term rainfall using the collected datasets of Indian Meteorological Department. The aim is to predict the rainfall tendency in different areas by using the past data of those areas.

## Datasets:

- Dataset1([dataset1](https://data.gov.in/resources/district-rainfall-normal-mm-monthly-seasonal-and-annual-data-period-1951-2000)) 
    - Average rainfall from 1951-2000 for each district, for every month.
- Dataset2([dataset2](https://data.gov.in/resources/subdivision-wise-rainfall-and-its-departure-1901-2015)) 
    - Average rainfall for every year from 1901-2015 for each state.


## Technologies Used:

-	Python - Python language is used for writing the server script, which takes the data from the given dataset then analyze the expecting output or prediction at approximate level.
-	Machine Learning – Machine learning is used to analyze the data.

## Conclusion: 

Data observations are done into various visualization which helps in implementing the approximate outputs. In some cases, the machine learning didn’t work due to the fluctuations in rainfalls in some areas.

## Future Scope: 

Helpful in Weather prediction and in understanding the rainfall sequences in different areas.
